# OLS Load Generator - Development Guide for AI

## Specs

No `.ai/spec/` directory yet. Specifications will be added when the codebase matures.

## Commands

```bash
make build    # Build the load generator binary
make test     # Run tests
make lint     # golangci-lint
```

## Conventions

- Go codebase — standard Go project layout
- Measures OLS performance under concurrent query load
- Scrapes cluster Prometheus metrics for analysis

## Git and PR Workflow

### Commit Messages
- Start with the Jira ticket reference: `OLS-XXXX description`
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood

### Pull Requests
This repo uses a **fork-based workflow**:

1. **Push to your fork**, not to `origin`
2. **Create the PR** against `origin/main` using your fork's branch:
   ```bash
   git push <your-fork-remote> <branch>
   gh pr create --repo <upstream-org>/ols-load-generator --head <your-github-user>:<branch> --base main
   ```
3. **PR title** must start with the Jira reference: `OLS-XXXX description`
4. **Squash commits** before pushing -- one logical commit per PR unless the PR explicitly tracks multiple independent changes

### Branch Completion
When finishing a development branch:
1. Remove any process artifacts (design docs, plans in `docs/superpowers/`)
2. Squash commits with the Jira-prefixed message
3. Push to the contributor's fork remote (not `origin`)
4. Create the PR against `origin/main` using `--head <user>:<branch>`
